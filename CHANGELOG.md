### Added
- Custom expressive AI emoticon badge (`ExpressiveAiIcon`) with smart animated/canvas smiling face, gradient visor, and star sparkle, distinct from standard emoji buttons.
- Natural-language AI writing assistant dialog accepting arbitrary user instructions (e.g. "correct my writing", "make this sound more natural", "translate into Indonesian", "turn this into lyrics").

### Added
- Rectangular "Formatted View" toggle button in the note editor toolbar positioned between Redo and Search (`Undo → Redo → Formatted View → Search → other tools`).
- Clear visual state for the toggle button with active container highlight, border, and dynamic Edit/View label.
- Clean, read-only formatted reading mode preserving actual note content and formatting in memory.
- Rich Markdown and block rendering: headings (`#`, `##`, `###`), bold (`**`/`__`), italic (`*`/`_`), strikethrough (`~~`), inline code (``` ` ```), multiline code blocks (```` ``` ````), blockquotes (`>`), dividers (`---`), numbered lists (`1.`), bullet lists (`-`/`*`/`•`), checklists, images, and handwriting strokes.
- Seamless switching between edit and reading view without losing cursor position, selection, or unsaved changes.
- Safe fallback rendering for unsupported block types preventing content loss or UI crashes.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- Zero-lag large text file engine capable of smoothly editing and previewing massive notes without UI frame drops.
- Automatic text virtualization: auto-chunks large text blocks (>6,000 characters) into granular blocks for smooth `LazyColumn` recycling.
- Debounced undo/redo snapshots (1.5s windowing) avoiding full array copies on every single keystroke.
- Zero-allocation character and word count calculations using `derivedStateOf` and fast single-pass `TextStats`.
- Bounded dashboard card previews (120 chars) and optimized history snapshots without full-text string joins.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- Enhanced in-note Search bar with Find Previous (`↑`) and Find Next (`↓`) navigation buttons.
- Real-time match counter badge (`1/5` matches) with auto-scroll and highlight jumping to matched blocks.

- Freely draggable image block positioning with `⠿ Drag to Move` vertical drag handle and instant Up (`↑`) / Down (`↓`) repositioning buttons.
- Real-time text re-flow: Surrounding text blocks dynamically adjust and flow around relocated images.
- Image caption support: Note text and captions stay linked to the image and travel together when moved.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- Window-style interactive image resizing:
  - Drag-corner handle (↘️ `OpenInFull`) to smoothly scale image width from 25% to 100% dynamically.
  - Quick window size presets (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) and Alignment controls (Left, Center, Right).
- Precise "Place Image Between Text" system:
  - Real-time visual landing drop marker (`📍 Placing image between next text...`) during drag gestures.
  - "Place Between Paragraphs..." dialog (`📍`) to instantly teleport an image between any specific paragraphs.
  - Cursor-aware insertion: Inserting an image while editing text automatically splits the paragraph and places the image directly between the top and bottom halves.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added & Changed
- Functional Interactive Calendar Tab:
  - Replaced the placeholder "Inbox" bottom navigation tab with a dedicated "Calendar" tab (`CalendarScreen.kt`).

  - Distinct highlights for Today vs Selected Date.
  - Tapping any date filters and displays notes created on that specific date in a scrollable list with title, content preview, creation time, category tag, tint, and attachment badges.
  - Tapping a note opens it directly in the full editor.
  - Clean empty state with "+ Create Note" action when a date has no notes.
  - 100% offline, zero network / external dependencies.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added & Enhanced
- Hold-to-Drag Image Moving:
  - Added `detectDragGesturesAfterLongPress` directly to note image blocks.
  - Pressing and holding an image triggers haptic feedback, elevates the image (`translationY`, shadow, scaling), and lets users drag it smoothly up or down between text paragraphs.
  - Interactive status pill indicates dynamic drag position and target landing spot.
  - Normal 1-finger swipes scroll the note without delay; 2-finger pinches dynamically scale image size.
- Updated Google Gemini Model Catalog:
  - Added current official models: `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.8-flash`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, and `gemini-flash-latest`.
  - Added Custom Model Identifier input field in the Gemini settings dialog so users can apply any custom model endpoint instantly.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added & Enhanced
- Two-Finger Pinch-to-Resize on Images:
  - Direct 2-finger pinch gesture smoothly resizes image width between 20% and 100% in real-time.
  - Resolved vertical scroll lock: Single-finger swipes over images pass directly to `LazyColumn`, allowing smooth scrolling up and down the note even when images sit at the top.
  - Image Size & Position Dialog: Tapping the bottom-right badge (`% 🤏`) opens quick width presets (`25%`, `50%`, `75%`, `100%`) and Alignment options (`Left`, `Center`, `Right`).
  - Top-left reordering pill with `↑` Move Up, `↓` Move Down, and `📍 Place Between Paragraphs`.
- Automatic Dashboard Return on Save:
  - Tapping the "Save" button in the Top App Bar saves changes, dismisses the keyboard, and automatically navigates back to the main dashboard.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed
- Standardized Android Debug Signing Configuration:
  - Removed custom `debugConfig` block referencing local root `debug.keystore`.
  - Configured `debug` build type to use AGP's standard automatic debug keystore.
  - Hardened release signing to dynamically activate only when `KEYSTORE_PATH` is defined and file exists.
  - Guaranteed error-free `assembleDebug` execution when cloned freshly in AndroidIDE.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-09-28

### Changed
- Complete Build Configuration Alignment for AndroidIDE & On-Device Compilation:
  - Gradle Wrapper configured to official Gradle 8.6 distribution (`gradle-8.6-bin.zip`).
  - Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) pinned to `8.4.1`.
  - Kotlin pinned to `1.9.23` with Compose compiler extension `1.5.11`.
